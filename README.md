## International Course "Bioinformatics and Genomic Tools for Biodiversity"

Welcome to the International Course "Bioinformatics and Genomic Tools for Biodiversity"

# Objectives

This workshop series is designed for people who want to:
1) learn the fundamentals of computational genomics
2) use this information to improve and expedite their research
3) expand their knowledge by hearing from experts in other subject areas

# Schedule

The course is organized in three weeks:
* Module 1 (March 14th - March 16th - March 18th)
* Module 2 (March 21th - March 23th - March 25th)
* Module 3 (March 28th - March 30th - April 1st)

For each week, there will be:
* 9 hours divided in three sessions
* 6-7 hours for student homework

During the last week, there will be 3 additional hours about seminars from International Speakers.
