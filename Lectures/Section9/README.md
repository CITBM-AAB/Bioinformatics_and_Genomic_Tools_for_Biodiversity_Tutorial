# Description
The adaptive evolution session will explore how a researcher can extract coding region (CDS) information from WGS, build and validate alignments and look for signatures of positive selection. We will show how to explore a small data set where one can perform all the required steps for a positive selection analysis, including writing a small report of the findings. 

# Objectives
1. Learn the basic steps to retrieve coding sequences from WGS

2. Build a MSA and validate it

3. Perform positive selection analyses

# Critical Concepts
CDS, Positive selection.
