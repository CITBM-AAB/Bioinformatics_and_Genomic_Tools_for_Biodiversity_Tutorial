# Description
Introduction to the use of a supercomputer using a resource manager. Among the topics to review we find the use of a queue manager, sending tasks to the cluster, preparation of necessary scripts, task monitoring, use of basic commands in a cluster, good use of computational resources, system of available software modules in the cluster and finally application scaling.

# Objectives
1.- Introduce a cluster as a great computational tool for research
2.- Understand the use of a cluster and its queue manager
3.- Teach different tools for monitoring scientific simulations launched in a cluster
4.- Provide concepts and tools necessary for the use of a high-performance cluster in our scientific simulations

# Critical Concepts
HPC, SLURM, Linux, Scaling, SpeedUp, Efficiency
