# Description
Unix/Linux is the standard operating system for scientific computing. Something similar happens with Windows, but on desktop computers (PC).
Following this comparison, the similarities between both Operating Systems are:
- They handle the hardware for you (networks, hard disks, processor).
- They provide an interface to run applications and store your files.
- Both have desktop interfaces that offer almost the same features.
On the other hand, Unix is secure, stable and allows the execution of tasks with multiple users. This has made it the operating system of choice for High Performance Computing (HPC). It can be used on different types of hardware from RaspberryPi, cell phones and tablets (Android), notebook and PC to supercomputers such as Leftraru of NLHPC.
