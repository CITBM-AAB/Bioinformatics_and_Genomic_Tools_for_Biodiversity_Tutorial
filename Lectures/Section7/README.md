# Description
The theoretical session of phylogenomics will explore the basic concepts of phylogenetic analyses and how they are applied to whole-genome information. We will describe how to handle several multiple sequence alignments (MSA) using a window-based approach and which tools are most indicated for each task. The practical session will give the students the opportunity to work with a smaller dataset to which they can apply the concepts and methods described during the first part.

# Objectives
1. Understand how you can build multiple sequence alignments from WGS

3. Explore what phylogenetic software is better suited for your problem

4. Build a modular pipeline to suit your needs

# Critical Concepts
Multiple sequence alignment; maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference.
