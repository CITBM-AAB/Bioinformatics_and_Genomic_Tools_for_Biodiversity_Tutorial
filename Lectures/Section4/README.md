# Instructor
* Manuel Ramirez

# Description
This course contains theoretical notes and practical examples that help to learn the initial concepts associated with the R language.

# Objectives
To introduce the student to the R programming language and the Rstudio development environments, which will be used throughout the course and which allow programming in R in a more user-friendly and visual way. 

In addition, the basic functions for importing and exporting data files of different formats and viewing them in Rstudio will be explained.
It will be completed with the first steps of R programming by defining the basic data types, operators and the most common data structures.

# Critical Concepts
R, Rstudio, basic functions, operators, and data structures.
