# Description
After a general background on population genetics and population genomics, the class will focus on the impact of low-coverage whole-genome data on population genomics and what tools are better suited in this case. Also, we are going to show how to explore the most common general analysis and statistics to evaluate the data quality and characterize the population you are working on. Further, we willl also mention how one can assess a speciesâ€™ historical demography using data from a single individual, using the PSMC approach. 

# Objectives
1. Understand the impacts of sequence coverage on downstream analyses

2. Explore the main concepts in population genomics

3. Learn how to plot some of the most common results

# Critical Concepts
Low coverage WGS; PCA; admixture; FST; Heterozygosity; PSMC.
